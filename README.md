### Hi devs ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a noob developer! I'm Playing with technology and try to learn new things deeply.

[My diary.](https://github.com/alirezaarzehgar/alirezaarzehgar/issues/1)

Now I'm trying to be an active developer in the Go developer community.
Yes, my contributions may be trivial in Go projects,
but they are just a gateway to becoming a great open-source contributor.

Naming yourself an Open Source Contributor may feel shameful if you only have some trivial changes.
[Check my commits on Golang.]([url](https://github.com/golang/go/commits/master/?author=alirezaarzehgar))

My activities tracked on [issues of this repository](https://github.com/alirezaarzehgar/alirezaarzehgar/issues/). I define my personal tasks on them. Usually it contain list of my books.

I love UNIX world, system programming, cloud computing and microservice architecture. Gaining deep knowledge is a great pleasure for me.

Interested in open source contribution. Fight with Go, love C and sometimes play with python.
