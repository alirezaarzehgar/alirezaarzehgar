### Hi devs ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a noob developer! I'm Playing with technology and try to learn new things deeply.

[My diary.](https://github.com/alirezaarzehgar/ali/issues/18)

My activities tracked on [issues of this repository](https://github.com/alirezaarzehgar/ali/issues/). I define my personal tasks on them. Usually it contain list of my books.

I love UNIX world, system programming, cloud computing and microservice architecture. Gaining deep knowledge is a great pleasure for me.

Interested in open source contribution. Fight with Go, love C and sometimes play with python.
